      <p>I have always been fascinated by navigating complex systems and building things.
        As a child I would use my lego sets to model city layouts and build stories and histories about
        why these things were the way they were.  I was fascinated by the underlying reasoning behind my constructs.
        In school, this developed into an enduring fascination with history and mathematics.<br><br>
        I first came to coding late in college while I was majoring in history.
        I took two computer science and datastructure courses in my last years there and was quite intrigued.
        One of my earliest projects was to develop a program that would solve sudoku puzzles using C++.
        The process of figuring out the logic I would need was engrossing and success was immensely satisfying.
        I initially did not feel I had the time to pursue that interest, however.  <br><br>After college,
        I worked as an analyst for a company that did behavioral analysis of business executives
        on behalf of investors, looking for signs of deceptive behaviors. The work
        was interesting but grew repetitive and I began looking for a career that would allow greater creativity.
        I returned to coding via General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program as it offered the best
        way for me to put my analytical mind and creative problem solving skills to good use.
        I am now dedicated to continuing to advance my technical knowledge and skills in order to meet my fullest potential.</p></div>

        <h2 class="project-head"><u>Boatyard</u></h2>
        <p>For my capstone project, I worked to build an app for helping boatyard
        managers keep records on the boats they store and projects performed on them.  To challenge myself, I chose to build a new backend database and build
        my front end with EmberJS, a new framework we had just been introduced to.  This created difficulties and I was forced to cut the project management
        feature from the initial version of the app in order to meet the the three day deadline for the project.  My backend was built using Ruby on Rails and
        deployed to heroku.  Version control was maintained with github repositories for both the front and back end.  <a href="https://github.com/PDSamson/boatyard-ember-client">See Repository</a></p>

        <h2 class="project-head"><u>Nozama</u></h2>
        <p>I worked with a team to build a mock e-commerce application integrating
        Stripe for payment management.  In my first team project, we used a shared github repository.  We carefully divided the work
        and used paired programming to minimize conflicts.  Our front end was created using HTML5, Javascript, jQuery, Handlebars and AJAX.
        We integrated Stripe into the order process for the secure handling of credit card information.  For our backend, we used ExpressJS to
        build a Mongodb database.  Ultimately we created an app that would allow an admin user to add/remove products and adjust product details, while
        allowing normal users to add products to a cart, submit orders, and view past orders. <a href="https://github.com/PDSamson/Nozama-Front-End">See Repository</a></p>

        <h2 class="project-head"><u>Event Tracker</u></h2>
        <p>For my first full-stack web application, I created a web app
        that allows users to create and store events in a database.  The front-end was built using
        Javascript, jQuery, Handlebars, HTML5 and integrated AJAX calls to interact with the back-end.  The backend was
        built using Ruby on Rails and deployed to Heroku.  Using shell commands and manual coding, I was able to build a relational database
        that allowed only the user to access and modify their owned events.  I used a github repository for both front and
        back ends to maintain version control of my project. <a href="https://github.com/PDSamson/event-tracker-browser">See Repository</a></p>

        <h2 class="project-head"><u>Tic-Tac-Toe</u></h2>
        <p>For my first web app project, I created a web app that allows the user to
        play a game of tic-tac-toe and record their wins and losses in a provided api.  I
        first set about working out the logic of the game itself and implementing it
        with Javascript, jQuery and HTML5.  This portion of the project came inuitively to me as I had worked
        with similar programming tasks before.  The challenge came in wrapping my
        head around implementing AJAX calls into my project in order to keep an updated record
        of game states and record the user's wins and losses.  I was able to successfully integrate
        this functionality into my app with reference to class notes and referencing the documentation.
        I used a git repository to maintain version control of my project. <a href="https://github.com/PDSamson/peters-tic-tac-toe">See Repository</a></p>
