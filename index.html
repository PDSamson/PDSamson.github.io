      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img class="me" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZDcAFMj.jpg" width="20%" alt="">
      <p>I have always been fascinated by navigating complex systems and learning
        to understand them. This was what drew my to coding initially in college
        and in a different way to my first job. I worked for a company that did
        behavioral analysis of business executives on behalf of investors,
        looking for signs of deceptive behaviors. The work was initially
        interesting but grew repetitive.  I returned to coding as it offered
        the best way for me to put my creative problem solving skills to work
        building and working with complex systems.</p>
