      <p>I have always been fascinated by navigating complex systems and building things.
        As a child I would use my lego sets to model city layouts and build stories and histories about
        why these things were the way they were.  I was fascinated by the underlying reasoning behind my constructs.
        In school, this developed into an enduring fascination with history and mathematics.<br><br>
        I first came to coding late in college while I was majoring in history.
        I took two computer science and datastructure courses in my last years there and was quite intrigued.
        One of my earliest projects was to develop a program that would solve sudoku puzzles using C++.
        The process of figuring out the logic I would need was engrossing and success was immensely satisfying.
        I initially did not feel I had the time to pursue that interest, however.  <br><br>After college,
        I worked as an analyst for a company that did behavioral analysis of business executives
        on behalf of investors, looking for signs of deceptive behaviors. The work
        was interesting but grew repetitive and I began looking for a career that would allow greater creativity.
        I returned to coding via General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program as it offered the best
        way for me to put my analytical mind and creative problem solving skills to good use.
        I am now dedicated to continuing to advance my technical knowledge and skills in order to meet my fullest potential.</p></div>
